# Social Network API

## Description

This is a back-end API for a social network web application that allows users to create accounts, share thoughts, react to other users' thoughts, and manage friend lists. It uses MongoDB as the database, Mongoose for object data modeling, and Express.js for routing. The API handles unstructured data efficiently and is tested using Insomnia.

### Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Insomnia (for API testing)

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/social-network-api.git

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Make sure MongoDB is running locally on your machine:
